This was a great project for me to learn more about machine learning, useful libraries, and create a fun experiecne to get excited for the Paris 2024 Olympics! Using a data set from Dataquest, I create a model in Jupyter Notebook that first identifies correlation between different variables and the medals a country wins, then I train a model based off the two most significant predictors, then I comment on the errors and limitations of the model.
