This was a great project for me to learn more about machine learning, useful libraries, and create a fun experience to get excited for the Paris 2024 Olympics! Using a data set from Dataquest, I create a model in Jupyter Notebook that first identifies correlation between different variables and the medals a country wins, then I train a model based off the two most significant predictors, then I comment on the errors and limitations of the model. My model predicts the U.S. to win 125 medals for 2024, and I am excited to see how accurate this is!
